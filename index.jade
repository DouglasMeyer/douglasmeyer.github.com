      small a man of few words

      | Centro 
      small Senior Software Engineer: 2006 - now
    p
      | When I started, it was a small development team of 5 people working on a
      | product for use within the company. This allowed me to be involved in
      | many aspects of software development including:
      +ems(['agile development', 'database migrations', 'deployment', 'product support', 'incorporating user feedback'])
      | .
    p
      | Since then, it has grown to a 50 person software team working on a
      | variety of internal and external products. This transition allowed me
      | to learn a more specific set of technologies. As I've worked at Centro
      | I've learned a number of technologies:
      +ems(['Ruby on Rails', 'CoffeeScript', 'jQuery', 'AngularJS', 'gulp.js', 'jade', 'Postgres', 'SASS (CSS)', 'SproutCore'])
      | .

    h3 Personal
    p
      | My passion for web-development has spilled-over into my personal
      | interests as well. Oftentimes, if I have an idea, I see if it works by
      | trying it out in a personal project.

    h4 Ledger
    p
      | This is a zero-sum budget program I developed to get my wife and I out
      | of rigid and fragile spreadsheets. I personally developed this project
      | using:
      +ems(['Ruby on Rails', 'Postgres', 'SASS', 'CoffeeScript', 'haml', 'AngularJS'])
      | In this project, I explored with different front-end frameworks and from
      | that was able to transition our products to use
      | <a href="http://github.com/DouglasMeyer/ledger/tree/angular">AngularJS</a>.

    h4 BuildJS
    p
      | This project was used to primarily learn the gulp front-end build
      | systems and node.js development. In developing it, I got to use:
      +ems(['gulp', 'bower', 'livereload', 'connect'])
      | .
