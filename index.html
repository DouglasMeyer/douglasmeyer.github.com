web-development experience, and recently I've been focusing on
front-end technologies. </p><h2>Work</h2><h3>Centro <small>Senior Software Engineer: 2006 - now</small></h3><p>When I started, it was a small development team of 5 people working on a
product for use within the company. This allowed me to be involved in
many aspects of software development including:<em>agile development</em>, <em>database migrations</em>, <em>deployment</em>, <em>product support</em>, <em>incorporating user feedback</em>.</p><p>Since then, it has grown to a 50 person software team working on a
variety of internal and external products. This transition allowed me
to learn a more specific set of technologies. As I've worked at Centro
I've learned a number of technologies:<em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>jQuery</em>, <em>AngularJS</em>, <em>gulp.js</em>, <em>jade</em>, <em>Postgres</em>, <em>SASS (CSS)</em>, <em>SproutCore</em>.</p><h3>Personal</h3><p>My passion for web-development has spilled-over into my personal
interests as well. Oftentimes, if I have an idea, I see if it works by
trying it out in a personal project.</p><h4>Ledger</h4><p>This is a zero-sum budget program I developed to get my wife and I out
of rigid and fragile spreadsheets. I personally developed this project
using:<em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>Postgres</em>, <em>SASS</em>, <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>haml</em>, <em>AngularJS</em>In this project, I explored with different front-end frameworks and from
that was able to transition our products to use
<a href="http://github.com/DouglasMeyer/ledger/tree/angular">AngularJS</a>.</p><h4>BuildJS</h4><p>This project was used to primarily learn the gulp front-end build
systems and node.js development. In developing it, I got to use:<em>gulp</em>, <em>bower</em>, <em>livereload</em>, <em>connect</em>.</p><h2>Play</h2><p>Running</p><p>github projects</p><h2>Details</h2><p>School and stuff</p>
