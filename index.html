Meyer</h1><p>I'm a senior software engineer with 7 years of professional
web-development experience, and recently I've been focusing on
front-end technologies. </p></article><article id="Centro"><aside><h2>2006 - now</h2><p>Senior Software Engineer</p></aside><h2>Centro</h2><p>When I started, it was a small development team of 5 people working on a
product for use within the company. This allowed me to be involved in
many aspects of software development including: <em>agile development</em>, <em>database migrations</em>, <em>deployment</em>, <em>product support</em>, <em>incorporating user feedback</em>.</p><p>Since then, it has grown to a 50 person software team working on a
variety of internal and external products. This transition allowed me
to learn a more specific set of technologies. As I've worked at Centro
I've learned a number of technologies: <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>jQuery</em>, <em>AngularJS</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>gulp.js</em>, <em>jade</em>, <em>Postgres</em>, <em>SASS (CSS)</em>, <em>SproutCore</em>.</p></article><article id="Personal-Projects"><h2>Personal Projects</h2><p>My passion for web-development has spilled-over into my personal
interests as well. Oftentimes, if I have an idea, I see if it works by
trying it out in a personal project.</p></article><article id="Ledger"><aside><h2>Skills</h2><em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>Postgres</em>, <em>SASS</em>, <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>haml</em>, <em>AngularJS</em></aside><h2>Ledger<a href="http://github.com/DouglasMeyer/ledger" title="on github"></a></h2><p>This is a zero-sum budget program I developed to get my wife and I out
of rigid and fragile spreadsheets. In this project, I explored with
different front-end frameworks and from that was able to transition
our products to use AngularJS.</p></article><article id="BuildJS"><aside><h2>Skills</h2><em>node</em>, <em>npm</em>, <em>gulp</em>, <em>bower</em>, <em>livereload</em>, <em>connect</em></aside><h2><a href="http://www.douglas-meyer.name/BuildJS" title="see it in action">BuildJS</a><a href="http://github.com/DouglasMeyer/BuildJS" title="on github"></a></h2><p>This project was used to primarily learn the gulp front-end build
systems and node.js development.</p></article><article id="git-backup"><aside><h2>Skills</h2><em>git</em>, <em>linux</em></aside><h2>git-backup<a href="http://github.com/DouglasMeyer/git-backup" title="on github"></a></h2><p>Git Backup/Restore is a utility that arose out of me wanting to backup
local changes to git projects without publishing them and without
duplicating information already on a remote server. Building this was
mostly about learning more about git and linux scripting.</p></article><article id="TestIt"><aside><h2>Skills</h2><em>node</em>, <em>npm</em>, <em>JavaScript</em></aside><h2><a href="http://www.douglas-meyer.name/test_it/" title="see it in action">TestIt</a><a href="http://github.com/DouglasMeyer/test_it" title="on github"></a></h2><p>A JS testing framework I wrote because, at the time, most JS testing
frameworks required a lot of setup before you could start testing.
Because of it's simplicity and versatility, it was used for JS testing
for a program where I worked.</p></article><article id="Education"><h2>Education</h2><p>Bachelors of Science in Computer Science @ Illinois Institute of Technology</p></article><script src="index.js"></script>
